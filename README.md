# RC-Car-
I recently worked on an exciting RC Soccer Robot project in my 3rd Semester Digital Logic Design (DLD) course. The robot is programmed using Arduino and can be controlled through serial commands (Bluetooth / Serial Monitor) to move in different directions, adjust speed, and even control headlights.
